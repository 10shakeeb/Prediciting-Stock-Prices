# Predicting the stock market

## 1) Introduction

In this project, we'll be working with a csv file containing index prices. Each row in the file contains a daily record of the price of the S&P500 Index from 1950 to 2015. The dataset is stored in the file "sphist.csv".

The columns of the dataset are:

- Date -- The date of the record.
- Open -- The opening price of the day (when trading starts).
- High -- The highest trade price during the day.
- Low -- The lowest trade price during the day.
- Close -- The closing price for the day (when trading is finished).
- Volume -- The number of shares traded.
- Adj Close -- The daily closing price, adjusted retroactively to include any corporate actions. Read more [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusted_closing_price.asp).
